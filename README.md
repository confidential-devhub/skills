## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI installed
- `~/.claude/commands/` directory (created automatically by Claude Code)

### Install a single command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/confidential-devhub/claude-skills
cp claude-skills/<command-name>/<command-name>.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

### Install all commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/confidential-devhub/claude-skills
for cmd_dir in claude-skills/*/; do
    cmd_name=$(basename "$cmd_dir")
    cp "$cmd_dir/$cmd_name.md" ~/.claude/commands/
done
```

Claude Code picks up files in `~/.claude/commands/` automatically — no restart required.

### Keep commands up to date

```bash
cd claude-skills
git pull
# Re-run the copy commands above
```

## Usage

Once installed, invoke a command with its slash command in any Claude Code session:

```
/cloud-api-adaptor setup
/cloud-api-adaptor build --debug
/cloud-api-adaptor test --filter TestLibvirtCreatePeerPod
```

Run any command with no arguments for an interactive prompt.

## Contributing

Each command lives in its own directory:

```
<command-name>/
├── <command-name>.md   # The command file (YAML frontmatter + Markdown body)
└── README.md           # Human-readable docs for the command
```

The command file frontmatter must include `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, and `allowed-tools`. Use an existing command as a template, then open a pull request.
